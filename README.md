# Geolocation-SS19

This app was created with the help of the great folks at RayWenderlich.com and the book iOS Apprentice.

The app developed was to use the Core Location framework to be able to obtain the GPS coordinates of where the user currently is. The iPhoneâ€™s camera and photo library were used to add a picture along with the name of the current coordinates, this allowed the UI to be more appealing. Once the location and picture were inserted, using Core Data the data of the location was stored in the database. Along with Core Location, Map Kit was utilised to be able to show the locations the user had pinned so that the locations could be accessed in the future and possibly re-visited.
